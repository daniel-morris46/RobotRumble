CMPT 370 - Meeting Sept 04

Overall feelings about the requirement document are that we did well and it was organized.

Come up with entities for the system.

Menu Entities:

Menu
Play Selection Screen
Options Selection Screen
Robot Librarian

Game entities:
Robot Teams *
Player
AI *
Board
Spectator

* Possibly the same

functions are not entities
buttons are probably not entities
but where the button lives would be an entity
